    <h2>Thanksgiving Special Recipes!</h2>
    <p>The best recipes come from those who pour their love into 
        their dishes. I believe the best time of the year lasts 
        from October to the end of December. This is when there 
        are stores, workplaces, and even neighborhoods collectively
        decide to change how thier locations look. If there is one 
        thing I persoanlly love is positive change. A massive part 
        of the reason behind my love for the holiday season is the 
        role food plays in bringing friends and loved ones alike 
        together! That is what lead to me changing this whole 
        website to showcase recipes I hope you all use as an excuse 
        to bring your friends and loved ones together. Much like I do!</p>
